Ive decided that it would be an intresting project to build a "simple" robotic arm

  

What are the goals of the project?

1. Learn the basics of robotics
	become aware of the hardware and software used for robotics
2. Achieve familiarity with cad tools 
3. Have fun and get a cool project out of it \\(^^)/

Where am i going to start?
	define the project

3 segment robotic arm with rotation at the base and the joints

what general things will i need?

1. base motor
2. 2 arm joint motors
3. 2 arms
4. 1 base joint
5. 1 base
6. 1 3d printed hand
