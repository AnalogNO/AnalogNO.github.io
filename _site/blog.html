      <p>Why write this?
I’m honestly not sure, writing has never really been a think I’ve done or a things I’ve thought a lot about doing. In the past few months I’ve been reading more blogs and more “smart” books. they often will talk about how writing can be a good thing and how its “Important to write” or other stuff like that. It might be true I’m honestly not sure. I did start doing some light journaling fall of last year and I’ve found that to be a pretty good thing. It seems to help me really nail down my mental state and actually solidify my feelings and thoughts on things in a more “real” way.</p>
